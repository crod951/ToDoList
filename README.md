# ToDoList

## Tasks I want to finish
- limit of tasks for quality not quantity - optional
- list of tasks
   - tags(color coded)
   - main subject (ex: "Personal", "Chores") - <b>done</b>
   - subtasks
   - priority
   - time estimates
   - due date
- select big 3 for the day
- show completed tasks
- weekly/calendar view
- show branching of subtasks
- reminders/alerts(low priority, maybe just mock)
- mind dump/sections(quantity of smaller tasks that might not want to be in to do list, but have option to. ex:main task with smaller notes of what user hopes to get done)
